--> What is Devops?
• The DevOps term means Development + Operations.
• It is the combination of practices and tools designed to increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services faster than traditional software development processes.
• This enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
• In simple terms, DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations.
• Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations.


--> Why Devops is Important?
• Shorter development cycles that encourage innovation.
• More collaboration, better communication.
• Reduced deployment failures and faster time to recover.
• Efficiency: Improved resource management.


--> What is Automation?
• Automation is a technology that enables processes to occur without human intervention. Essentially, “automating” tasks means creating a situation where the system (or part of a system) will run by itself.
• Early on, automation mostly referred to physical machinery that helps carry out laborious tasks such as printing text or manufacturing cars.
• This has drastically shifted in the modern age. Now, enterprises and individuals can adopt software solutions from third-party companies to automate tasks.
• These tasks could be as simple as automated emails being sent at specific times, or as complex as preventing global cyberattacks from occurring.


--> What is Scaling?
• Scaling or Scalability is the measure of a system’s ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changes in application and system processing demands.
• Examples would include how well a hardware system performs when the number of users is increased. 
• how well a database withstands growing numbers of queries, or how well an operating system performs on different classes of hardware.


--> What is Infrastructure?
• Infrastructure are the components required to operate and manage enterprise IT environments. IT infrastructure can be deployed within a cloud computing system, or within an organization's own facilities.
• These components include hardware, software, networking components, an operating system (OS), and data storage, all of which are used to deliver IT services and solutions.
• IT infrastructure products are available as downloadable software applications that run on top of existing IT resources—like software-defined storage or as online solutions offered by service providers like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).
